## How It Works

Genre Manager registers genre-based sections with the Home Screen Sections plugin at startup. Each selected genre becomes available as a section that you can enable and configure in the Home Screen Sections settings.

The sections are fully native to Jellyfin - they use the same rendering and styling as built-in sections like "Continue Watching" and "Recently Added".

## Troubleshooting

### Sections not appearing

1. Make sure **Home Screen Sections** plugin is installed and enabled
2. Restart Jellyfin after changing Genre Manager configuration
3. Check that you've enabled the genre sections in **Home Screen Sections ‚Üí Section Settings**
4. Verify that you have media items tagged with the selected genres

### No items in genre sections

- Ensure your media is properly tagged with genre metadata
- Genre names must match exactly (e.g., "Science Fiction" not "Sci-Fi")
- Run a library scan to update metadata
